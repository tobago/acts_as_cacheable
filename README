ActsAsCacheable
===============

Caches a collection of ActiveRecord objects and ActiveResource objects as well for performance reasons (means not to hurt the database in these cases).
This caching mechanism is intended for caching lookup objects, which won't be changed for longer periods of time, e.g. departments of a comapany.
