ActsAsCacheable
===============

Caches a collection of ActiveRecord objects and ActiveResource objects as well for performance reasons (means not to hurt the database in these cases).
This caching mechanism is intended for caching lookup objects, which won't be changed for longer periods of time, e.g. departments of a comapany.


Example
=======

class Department < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_cacheable :order => 'name', :reload => 10.minutes, :key => :name
end

class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to_cached :department
end

departments = Departments.all
departments = Departments[2..4]
department = Department.first
department = Department.last
department = Department.find_by_id 2
department = Department[2]
department = Department === 'Design Engineering'

person = Person.first
dep = person.department # doing one database query --> department
dep.id # --> 3
dep.name # --> 'Marketing'
person.department = Department[2] # not hurting the database once again, due to caching --> departament
person.save # --> true
